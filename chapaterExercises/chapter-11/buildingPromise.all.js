// As we saw, given an array of promises, Promise.all returns a promise that waits for all of the promises in the array to finish. It then succeeds, yielding an array of result values. If a promise in the array fails, the promise returned by all fails too, passing on the failure reason from the failing promise.

// Implement something like this yourself as a regular function called Promise_all.

// Remember that after a promise has succeeded or failed, it canâ€™t succeed or fail again, and further calls to the functions that resolve it are ignored. This can simplify the way you handle a failure of your promise.

function Promise_all(promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let results = [];
    let pending = promises.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < promises.length; i++) {
      promises[i]
        .then((result) => {
          results[i] = result;
          pending--;
          if (pending == 0) resolve(results);
        })
        // then() is called on the promise to handle its resolution. The result of the resolved promise is stored in the results array at the corresponding index. The pending counter is decremented each time a promise resolves. If pending becomes 0, meaning all promises have resolved, the outer promise is resolved with the results array.
        .catch(reject);
      // catch() is used to handle any promise rejection. If any promise in the array rejects, the outer promise is immediately rejected with that rejection reason.
    }
    if (promises.length == 0) resolve(results);
    // If the promises array is empty (i.e., promises.length == 0), it directly resolves with an empty array results.
  });
}
